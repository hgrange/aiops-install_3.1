## Show it

### Offline Click Through Demo

If you need an easy and fast way to demo AIOps in an "almost real" way you can use the Click Through Demo built with PowerPoint.


The file is [AIOps INTERACTIVE DEMO 3.1 2021](./AIOps_INTERACTIVE_DEMO_2021_3.1_V14.ppsx) in this repository.

I have added a short [Demo Walkthrough](https://ibm.box.com/s/8kxbb50dt4vkari2gsiw0hrin9gi6ivp) video.

**NEW:** A special version of the PowerPoint with highlighted click targets will make it easier for you to train for a fluid presentation [AIOps INTERACTIVE DEMO 3.1 2021 - TRAINING PPT](./AIOps_INTERACTIVE_DEMO_2021_3.1_V8_TRAINING.ppsx) 

## Install it

Find instructions to install your personal demo environment in the [README INSTALLATION](./README_INSTALLATION.md) file.
Make sure you use the [INSTALLATION CHECKLIST](./README_INSTALLATION_CHECKLIST.md) to make sure you don‚Äôt miss a step. There's lots of it üòú
